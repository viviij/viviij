My name is Victor Donizete, i'm from Brazil and I'm 20.
I'm studying Systems Analysis and Development, graduating at the end of 2022. 
I find programming something magical, like the drawings it's like everything is within my reach
Despite not having any professional experience, I have been programming since 2019
I decided to take programming as something more than a hobby
